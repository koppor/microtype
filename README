      An interface to the micro-typographic extensions of pdfTeX
                =================================
                       v1.9d    2006/05/05


* Overview
 ----------

The `microtype' package provides an interface  to  the  micro-typographic
extensions  of  pdfTeX:  most  prominently, character protrusion and font
expansion, furthermore the possibility to disable all ligatures of a font.
It allows to apply these features to customizable sets of fonts,  and  to
configure  all  micro-typographic  aspects  of  the  fonts in a straight-
forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts are provided.

Note:  Font expansion and character protrusion will only work with pdfTeX,
at least version 0.14f.  Automatic font expansion  requires version 1.20a
or newer. The package will by default enable the features that can safely
be assumed to work.

The documentation can be found in microtype.pdf resp. microtype.dvi.

A preview of the next version  is also included,  which supports  the new
experimental extensions of pdfTeX: adjustment of interword spacing (glue)
and the possibility to specify additional character kerning.
