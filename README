                     The `microtype' package
      An interface to the micro-typographic features of pdfTeX
               ====================================


* Overview
-----------

The `microtype' package  provides a  LaTeX interface to  pdfTeX's micro-
typographic extensions: character protrusion and font expansion.
   It allows to  restrict character protrusion and/or font expansion to
a definable set of fonts, and to configure micro-typographic aspects of
the fonts in a straight-forward and flexible way.
   Settings for various fonts are provided.

Note that font expansion and character protrusion only works  with  the
pdfTeX  compiler,  at  least  version  0.14f,  resp.  version 1.20a for
automatic font expansion.

The documentation can be found in microtype.pdf resp. microtype.dvi.


* Installation
---------------

 - Run latex on microtype.ins to generate the package and
   configuration files.
 - Put all files into a directory where LaTeX will find them,
   e.g. TEXMF/tex/latex/microtype.

 - Run latex twice on microtype.dtx to create the documentation.
 - For an index run:
      makeindex -s gind.ist -o microtype.ind microtype.idx
 - For the change history run:
      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o microtype.gls microtype.glo
