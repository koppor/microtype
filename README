         Subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection

* Overview
 ----------

The `microtype' package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic
extensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also propagated to
XeTeX and LuaTeX: most prominently, character protrusion and font expansion,
furthermore the adjustment of interword spacing and additional kerning, as
well as hyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to disable
all or selected ligatures.
These features may be applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a straight-forward
and flexible way. Settings for various fonts are provided.

Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX (version 0.14f or later),
LuaTeX, or XeTeX (at least version 0.9997). Font expansion works with pdfTeX
(version 1.20 for automatic expansion) or LuaTeX. The package will by default
enable protrusion and expansion if they can safely be assumed to work.
Disabling ligatures requires pdfTeX (at least version 1.30) or LuaTeX, while
the adjustment of interword spacing and of kerning only works with pdfTeX
(at least 1.40). Letterspacing is available with pdfTeX (1.40) or LuaTeX (0.62).

The alternative package `letterspace', which also works with plain TeX,
provides the user commands for letterspacing only, omitting support for all
other extensions.

The documentation can be found in microtype.pdf.


* Installation
 --------------

 - Run latex on microtype.ins to generate the package and configuration files
 - Move all generated files into a directory where LaTeX will find them,
   e.g., TEXMF/tex/latex/microtype/

 - Run (pdf)latex twice on microtype.dtx to create the documentation
 - For an index run:
      makeindex -s gind.ist -o microtype.ind microtype.idx
 - For the change history run:
      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o microtype.gls microtype.glo
