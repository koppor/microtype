                     The `microtype' package
      An interface to the micro-typographic extensions of pdfTeX
               ====================================


* Overview
-----------

The `microtype' package  provides an interface  to the  micro-typographic
extensions of pdfTeX: character protrusion and font expansion.  It allows
to restrict  font expansion and/or character protrusion to a customizable
set of fonts, and to configure all micro-typographic aspects of the fonts
in a  straight-forward and flexible way.  Settings for  various fonts are
provided.

Note:  Font expansion and character protrusion will only work with pdfTeX,
at least version 0.14f.  Automatic font expansion  requires version 1.20a
or newer. The package will by default enable the features that can safely
be assumed to work.

The documentation can be found in microtype.pdf resp. microtype.dvi.


* Installation
---------------

 - Run latex on microtype.ins to generate the package and
   configuration files.
 - Move all files into a directory where LaTeX will find them,
   e.g. TEXMF/tex/latex/microtype.

 - Run latex twice on microtype.dtx to create the documentation.
 - For an index run:
      makeindex -s gind.ist -o microtype.ind microtype.idx
 - For the change history run:
      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o microtype.gls microtype.glo
