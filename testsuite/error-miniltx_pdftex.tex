 `Margin kerning is the \textls[200]{adjustments of \tenit\lsstyle the \lslig{ch}aracters at the margins} of a
  typeset text. A simplified employment of margin kerning is \textls*{hanging
  punctuation}. Margin kerning is needed for \textls*[150]{optical alignment} of the margins
  of a typeset text, because mechanical justification of the margins makes
  them look rather ragged. Some characters can make a line appear shorter to
  the human eye than others. Shifting \textls{such} characters by an appropriate
  amount into the margins would greatly improve the appearance of a typeset
  text.
